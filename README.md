# Pacmen

#### Project Description

A twist on an ancient game: PacMan. Now we play PacMen (many of them). Add the pacmen with a click of a button and watch them bounce of the screen. Created using Javascript.   

#### How to Run

- git clone https://github.com/kizzen/pacmen.git
- cd pacmen
- drag and drop index.html into your browser

Alternatively, just visit this link: https://kizzen.github.io/pacmen/

#### Future improvements

- change background color
- have the pacmen stop moving by left clicking the mouse
- create the full pacman game (itâ€™s more fun than this one)
